**Decision 2 - UI Framework**

**Choice: React Native.**

A choice of React Native fits the development of this app rather than Xamarin.

**Rationale**

React Native uses JavaScript and React to build platform-specific UI components while Xamarin uses C# and the .NET framework. Both allow developers to write a single codebase for the interface working across both iOS and Android platforms. According to [1], the market share of using React Native is 40% compared to 11% of Xamarin. In addition, Xamarin will be replaced by .NET MAUI in 2024 which requires developers to obtain new skills and knowledge which results in more time and effort on app development.

**Consequences**

With consideration of the popularity of usage, the market share of React Native is significantly higher than that of Xamarin. The community support from React Native is higher. There is also no planned transformation of React Native. Developers who are already familiar with these skills are not required to acquire new skills and knowledge. Development time can be shortened.
Because of the upcoming transformation from Xamarin to .NET MAUI, developers need additional time and effort to learn and master the new skills. They may be more likely to make mistakes initially. Using React Native for a UI Framework of this app is a better decision.
