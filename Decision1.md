**Decision 1 - Mobile App Type**

**Choice: Native Mobile App**

Based on the needs of optimal performance, device-specific features, and offline functionality, the native mobile app has been chosen from the web and hybrid app.

**Rationale**

Our primary target users are using both the main platforms iOS and Android. A native mobile app can deliver optimal performance, leverage device-specific features, and support offline functionality. Native apps are platform-specific, designed explicitly for iOS and Android, enabling users to benefit from platform-specific capabilities, and ensuring smooth offline operation by efficiently managing device resources and data storage.

**Consequences**

Because of its optimal performance and device-specific features such as offline data and resource access, users can access the locally stored content of the app in offline mode. Users can notice the appâ€™s high polish, responsiveness, and smooth interactions which enhance user experience.
