**Decision 1 - Mobile App Type**

**Choice: Naꢀve Mobile App**

Based on the needs of opꢀmal performance, device-speciﬁc features, and oﬄine funcꢀonality, the naꢀve

mobile app has been chosen from the web and hybrid app.

**Raꢀonale**

Our primary target users are using both the main plaꢁorms iOS and Android. A naꢀve mobile app can

deliver opꢀmal performance, leverage device-speciﬁc features, and support oﬄine funcꢀonality. Naꢀve

apps are plaꢁorm-speciﬁc, designed explicitly for iOS and Android, enabling users to beneﬁt from

plaꢁorm-speciﬁc capabiliꢀes, and ensuring smooth oﬄine operaꢀon by eﬃciently managing device

resources and data storage.

**Consequences**

Because of its opꢀmal performance and device-speciﬁc features such as oﬄine data and resource access,

users can access the locally stored content of the app in oﬄine mode. Users can noꢀce the app’s high

polish, responsiveness, and smooth interacꢀons which enhance user experience.
