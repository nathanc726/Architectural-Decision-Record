**Decision 4 - Permissions**

**Decision: Granular permissions system**

The app needs to obtain permission from users before enabling its funcꢀonaliꢀes to protect user’s

personal data and privacy.

**Raꢀonale**

The single Consent approach is a straighꢁorward approach to obtaining permission from users to grant or

deny access to all requested permissions at once. Conversely, Granular permissions allow users to

conﬁgure the privacy and security level by granꢀng or denying each speciﬁc funcꢀon or feature one by

one.

**Consequences**

This app requires permission from users to enable several funcꢀons including push noꢀﬁcaꢀons

and user behavior tracking. If using Single Consent, users may overlook and unintenꢀonally grant

access to the app which may lead to unplanned data authorizaꢀon to the app. Having speciﬁc

permissions conﬁgured one by one requires the user’s addiꢀonal input, it safeguards the user’s

privacy which enhances user trust and conﬁdence.
