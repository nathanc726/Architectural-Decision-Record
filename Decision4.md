**Decision 4 - Permissions**

**Decision: Granular permissions system**

The app needs to obtain permission from users before enabling its functionalities to protect user’s personal data and privacy. 

**Rationale**

The single Consent approach is a straightforward approach to obtaining permission from users to grant or deny access to all requested permissions at once. Conversely, Granular permissions allow users to configure the privacy and security level by granting or denying each specific function or feature one by one. 

**Consequences**

This app requires permission from users to enable several functions including push notifications and user behavior tracking. If using Single Consent, users may overlook and unintentionally grant access to the app which may lead to unplanned data authorization to the app. Having specific permissions configured one by one requires the user’s additional input, it safeguards the user’s privacy which enhances user trust and confidence.
