**Decision 6 - Addiꢀonal Frameworks or Technology Stacks**

**Decision: Firebase for push noꢀﬁcaꢀon, payment gateway, analyꢀcs integraꢀon.**

**Image Opꢀmizaꢀon by using the format of JPEG.**

Firebase provides a robust set of tools and services such as push noꢀﬁcaꢀons, payment gateway

integraꢀon, and analyꢀcs. The image format of JPEG is chosen for image opꢀmizaꢀon.

**Raꢀonale**

Firebase is a comprehensive tool to easily migrate diﬀerent funcꢀons (including analyꢀcs, message real-

ꢀme delivery, and payment) into the app that streamlines common mobile app features resulꢀng in a

reducꢀon of development eﬀort and ꢀme. Analyꢀc tools monitor user behavior and app performance and

help make data-driven decisions by having insights from user data. The format of JPEG maintains images

in high resoluꢀon with a lower ﬁle size.

AWS and Microsoꢁ Azure also oﬀer tools for push noꢀﬁcaꢀons, payment gateways, and analyꢀcs. However,

it requires more extensive development and conﬁguraꢀon. Firebase is more like a mobile-focused plaꢂorm

speciﬁcally, it is easier to learn and user-friendly which can streamline the integraꢀon process.

With the use of JPEG image format, images can be opꢀmized for browsing, loading, and storage. Although

WebP can perform the same features as JPEG, its color proﬁle is more limited than that of JPEG.

**Consequences**

Push noꢀﬁcaꢀon, analyꢀcs, and payment gateway provided by Firebase can work across diﬀerent

plaꢂorms resulꢀng in implementaꢀon simplicity. Firebase’s security features help protect sensiꢀve

payment informaꢀon by using data encrypꢀon and compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security

Standard requirements [2]. Analysis generated by analyꢀc tools provides detailed insights into user

behavior and app usage, helping developers to ﬁne-tune and further develop the app. Image opꢀmizaꢀon

leads to higher loading and storage eﬃciency that reduces the load on both user devices and servers while

maintaining relaꢀvely high image resoluꢀon. A beꢃer browsing experience can be delivered to users,

especially where bandwidth and storage constraints occur.

It is important to note that the cost of using Firebase can be very high if the usage volume such as frequent

payment processing is large. Since event tracking is enabled in the app (when the user enables this

funcꢀon), improper handling of user data can result in legal and reputaꢀon issues. Clear, logical, and strict

data governance is solely dependent on how the company designs it. If improper government is set, user’s

privacy and data cannot be safeguarded. Furthermore, JPEG does not support lossless compression. If the

image is heavily compressed, the loss of quality is noꢀceable.
