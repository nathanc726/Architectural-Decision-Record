**Decision 6 - Additional Frameworks or Technology Stacks**

**Decision: Firebase for push notification, payment gateway, analytics integration.**

**Image Optimization by using the format of JPEG.**

Firebase provides a robust set of tools and services such as push notifications, payment gateway integration, and analytics. The image format of JPEG is chosen for image optimization.

**Rationale**

Firebase is a comprehensive tool to easily migrate different functions (including analytics, message real-time delivery, and payment) into the app that streamlines common mobile app features resulting in a reduction of development effort and time. Analytic tools monitor user behavior and app performance and help make data-driven decisions by having insights from user data. The format of JPEG maintains images in high resolution with a lower file size. 
AWS and Microsoft Azure also offer tools for push notifications, payment gateways, and analytics. However, it requires more extensive development and configuration. Firebase is more like a mobile-focused platform specifically, it is easier to learn and user-friendly which can streamline the integration process.
With the use of JPEG image format, images can be optimized for browsing, loading, and storage. Although WebP can perform the same features as JPEG, its color profile is more limited than that of JPEG.

**Consequences**

Push notification, analytics, and payment gateway provided by Firebase can work across different platforms resulting in implementation simplicity. Firebase’s security features help protect sensitive payment information by using data encryption and compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requirements [2]. Analysis generated by analytic tools provides detailed insights into user behavior and app usage, helping developers to fine-tune and further develop the app. Image optimization leads to higher loading and storage efficiency that reduces the load on both user devices and servers while

maintaining relatively high image resolution. A better browsing experience can be delivered to users, especially where bandwidth and storage constraints occur. 
It is important to note that the cost of using Firebase can be very high if the usage volume such as frequent payment processing is large. Since event tracking is enabled in the app (when the user enables this function), improper handling of user data can result in legal and reputation issues. Clear, logical, and strict data governance is solely dependent on how the company designs it. If improper government is set, user’s privacy and data cannot be safeguarded. Furthermore, JPEG does not support lossless compression. If the image is heavily compressed, the loss of quality is noticeable.
